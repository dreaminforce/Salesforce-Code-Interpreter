# OpenAI Assistant Code Interpreter in Salesforce Communities

Welcome to the GitHub repository for implementing **OpenAI Assistant's Code Interpreter** within **Salesforce Communities**!

In this project, I aim to demonstrate how the capabilities of the **OpenAI Assistant's Code Interpreter** can be seamlessly integrated into **Salesforce Communities**, providing a powerful AI-driven tool for code execution, data analysis, and enhanced customer engagement. By leveraging Salesforce's robust community platform and OpenAI's intelligent interpreter, we can elevate user interactions and automate complex tasks in a dynamic and intuitive way.

Stay tuned as I will be pushing the code soon, along with detailed documentation and implementation steps. This repository will serve as a comprehensive guide to bringing AI-enhanced solutions into **Salesforce Communities**.
